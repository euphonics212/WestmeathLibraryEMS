LibraryEMS Events Management System - ASP.NET MVC5 The Libraries run events over the course of a year and use Microsoft Excel to track and document these events. The problem with tracking events in this way is that all libraries in the county use the same excel sheet, and that errors and accidental deletions pose risks to the validity of the data.

Apart from managing the event, the Excel sheet is used to generate reports and statistics so that the library can better manage their resources. The application aims to make managing these tasks simpler and more intuitive, as well as offering ways to customise the inputs and outputs. The system is developed using Microsoftâ€™s ASP.NET Framework, using the MVC Design Pattern. The programming language used is C# and the version of the framework core 3.1. It leverages Entity frameworks core using the code first approach and Migrations Uses EPPlus for Excel Imports
